# Backward incompatibility with modules using the gallery uploader

There is a BC with modules using the gallery uploader. I've investigated the issue and a "simple" fix is unfortunately not possible for a few reasons:

* the uploader config has been split into two different models (uploader and button config)
* the js constructor has been modified from 3 to 2 parameters

Thus I have written a small documentation to make your modules backward/forward compatible between version: http://magento.stackexchange.com/a/142013/2380
